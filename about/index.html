                    <h3>Rami Haider, P.Geo</h3>
                    <p class="member-title">Founder</p>

                    <p class="member-bio">
                        Rami holds a B.S. in Applied Mathematics and Geology from the University of Western Ontario and an M.S. in Data Science from the University of Michigan. He has over 4 years of field experience in geological mapping and prospecting across northern Ontario, including IP ground surveys, environmental assessment work with Stantec, and geophysical interpretation and GIS.
                    </p>
                    <p class="member-bio">
                        He spent 2+ years at a startup as a Machine Learning Engineer and Subject Matter Expert in Geosciences, developing CNN and XGBoost ensemble methods for mineral targeting. He also served as a Data Engineer, leading a team of 5 in data and ML engineering.
                    </p>
                    <p class="member-bio">
                        Most recently, Rami spent 3+ years at Sander Geophysics developing AI/ML applications to automate geophysical workflows, deploying models to production, processing airborne geophysical data (magnetics, gravity, EM, radiometrics), and providing geological interpretation of survey results.
                    </p>
                    <p class="member-bio">
                        Beyond geoscience, Rami brings 7+ years of full stack development and UX/UI experience. He is also a co-founder of 1stOpLaundry, where he continues to serve as Head of Finance and Data Analytics, having helped grow the company to well over $500K in annual revenue across Canada with expansion into the US on the horizon.
                    </p>
                    <p class="member-bio">
                        With this unique combination of hands-on field geology, geophysical expertise, applied machine learning, and proven entrepreneurial experience, Rami is exceptionally well positioned to build robust models for mineral prospectivity mapping.
                    </p>
